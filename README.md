## Technical explanation

### Simulation

The code solves an energy balance equation by considering an interval initial time t0 and end time t1, the equation is given by ![\Delta Ec = \eta P \Delta t + \Delta Ep - E_diss](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5CDelta%20Ec%20%3D%20%5Ceta%20P%20%5CDelta%20t%20&plus;%20%5CDelta%20Ep%20-%20E_diss)
where on the right-hamd side:

- ![\Delta Ec = Ec(t_1) - Ec(t_0)](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5CDelta%20Ec%20%3D%20Ec%28t_1%29%20-%20Ec%28t_0%29) is the kinetic’s energy difference.
- ![\eta P \Delta t](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Ceta%20P%20%5CDelta%20t) the rider’s energy input.
- ![\Delta Ep](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5CDelta%20Ep) potential energy difference generated by the road’s slope.
- ![Ediss](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?Ediss) accounts for the dissipated energy by rolling resistance and air drag.

### Coefficients

Coefficients for rolling resistance (Cr) and drag resistance (Cd) are needed for the energy balance equation.
For the road bike Cr’s initial value at 0.1 m/s is taken as Cr = 0.005 (relatively smooth asphalt, mid-market 28’ tyres) and Cd = 0.68 at 15 m/s (see ‚CFD ‚analysis of an exceptional cyclist sprinter position‘, Blocken et al.). Slope for Cd is that for the recreational bike mentioned in ‚Bicycle ‚aereodynamics: an experimental evaluation methodology (Chowdhury, H., Alam, F.). Cr is varied according to our own data for a 28‘ tyre.
Cd’s value for the unfaired recumbent bike is taken basing on CdA = 0.18 at at 50 km/h (see The Recumbent Bicycle and Human Powered Vehicle Information Center) and Area = 0.2. An interpolation of this curve yields values for Cd at speeds different from 50 km/h. Cr stays unchanged with respect to the road bike.
Coefficients for Taurus are set with values similar to its estimated ones. Shape is maintained, but with respect to a different reference value at v=120 km/h, which is Cd(v=120 km/h) = 0.04. Cr's values are experimental values obtained. 

| Vehicle | Cd@120 km/h | Cr | Frontal Area (m²) |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
|Road bike | 1.036*Cd(v=120km/h) at 0.1 m/s; slope = - 2.88*10^{-4} , yielding Cd = 1.0933 at 20 m/s   | 0.005 at 0,1 m/s;slope = + 3*10^{-6} every 0.1 m/s, yielding Cr = 0.0056 at 20 m/s    | 100 < h <= 165 => 0.34; 165 < h <= 175 => 0.38; 175 < h <= 185 => 0.43; 185 < h <= 200 => 0.48|
Unfaired recumbent bike |    same as above | same as above |  100 < h <= 165 => 0.26; 165 < h <= 175 => 0.29; 175 < h <= 185 => 0.32; 185 < h <= 200 => 0.36 |
Taurus | 1.4843*0.04 at 0.1 m/s; 1.0691*0.04 at 40 m/s | 0.0029 at 0.1 m/s;  0.0045 at 40 m/s |0.04 |

## How to use it

### Windows/MacOs/Chrome OS/Android

1. Go to [policumbent.it/whpsc-sim](https://www.policumbent.it/whpsc-sim/)
2. Connect your bluetooth powermeter. (This functionality is available only in Google Chrome 83+)
3. Start a new run

### Linux

1. How you can see [here](https://github.com/WebBluetoothCG/web-bluetooth/blob/gh-pages/implementation-status.md), Linux version of bluettoth API are partially implemented and not supported. So you need to enable `chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features`.
1. Go to [policumbent.it/whpsc-sim](https://www.policumbent.it/whpsc-sim/)
1. Connect your bluetooth powermeter. (This functionality is available only in Google Chrome 83+ and on linux may not work)
1. Start a new run

## Requirements

- **Android**: Requires Android 6.0 Marshmallow or later.
- **Mac**: Requires OS X Yosemite or later. (Some MacBooks may not work: Check "About this Mac" / "System Report" / "Bluetooth" and verify that Low Energy is supported.)
- **Linux**: Requires Kernel 3.19+ and BlueZ 5.41+ installed. Read How to get Chrome Web Bluetooth working on Linux.(Note that Bluetooth daemon needs to run with experimental interfaces if BlueZ version is lower than 5.43: sudo /usr/sbin/bluetoothd -E)
- **Windows**: Requires Windows 10 version 1706 (Creators Update) or later.
